# Introduction: bnbselect
TOO MANY CHOICES! Give me quality recomendations!

Have you ever gone on Airbnb and had too many options to choose from even after you put all your filters? 
What if someone could just read/scroll through all the descriptions, reviews, and images to narrow down to the options you might ACTUALLY be interested in? 

Bnbselect is an autonomous agent who will narrow down the airbnb options for you.
By entering your preferences once, bnbselect will remember your preferences, scrape all the texts and the images, and curate a list of top matches.

Let's say, you want to find a house in New York. Because you have children, you need a room with at least 3 beds. 
You would also prefer rooms with free wifi, a good view, and a location close to the metro. 

These preferences will most most likely not change, so bnbselect will remember these your personal preferences and provide you with the best k matches.
