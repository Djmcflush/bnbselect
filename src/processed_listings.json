We were also required to show our car registration which we were not told ahead of time and caused difficulties entering the premises to begin with. With that said, it was wildly overpriced especially considering there was nothing but the bare minimums in the house. For example, there were no coffee mugs although there was a coffee maker, the hot tub was nothing more than a heart-shaped bathtub with jets that did not stay warm, we were left two stray garbage bags, and the silverware/cookware was sparse to say the least (not even salt and pepper). There were also no complimentary toiletries. There was no cable television and when I asked the host he said that the TV was not working 3 days prior to our arrival, which we should have been made aware of, however when we checked around the televisions we noticed there was no setup for cable to begin with and believe there was never access. Although the place was clean and the location was nice, it was clear it meets the bare minimum.

With nearly everything from Coffee, Restaurants, Shopping, Convenience Stores & Transportation at your front door, Anthony's place is a sure win for those looking to be close to the action without being in the center of all the noise!  A sure win for my Parents who are both in their 60\\u2019s.\", \"Book it before it\\u2019s gone\", \"Most disappointing Airbnb experience so far.  <br/>Check-in was late.  We had to wait outside for cleaners to clean.  Anthony called and apologized and offered to pay for our lunch to address the inconvenience.  I wasn\\u2019t fussed about the late check-in and didn\\u2019t think the compensation was necessary - things don\\u2019t always go according to plan and the guests before us overstaying is not something over which Anthony had full control.<br/>The bed was unchanged from the last guests and was visibly dirty.  We got into the apartment to find a bed made with dirty linen and hair all over the bed.  I messaged Anthony and he got the cleaners back in immediately to change the bed.<br/>The bathroom sink was clogged.  The cleaners told me someone was coming back to fix the sink. Nobody came. I messaged Anthony about the sink and got no response.<br/>For the rest of the stay Anthony was completely non responsive.  Despite my displeasure at this point, I tidied the place, washed and replaced dishes, stripped the bed of used linen, and cleaned the muck left behind from using a clogged sink.<br/>For the almost $700 Canadian dollars I paid for two nights at Anthony\\u2019s place I could have gotten far better accommodations in NYC!  I would not book with Anthony again.\", \"Anthony was extremely accommodating,  we got in way before the usual check<br/>In time and he helped us out and got us in early! Great location, quick walk to subway and all kinds of connections. Nice and quiet area but just a short walk to everything you need, including great food! We were stoked off this place. Highly recommend.\", \"Great location and super accommodating and responsive host!

Nice location in Manhattan as it feels more residential and less touristy though it is still close enough to tourist sites including Midtown and Central Park.  Staying here made exploring the Upper East Side, an area of Manhattan I didn\\u2019t know as well, easy.  The Queensborough Bridge is right out your window so expect more traffic noise in this 2nd floor walk up.\", \"Anthony\\u2019s place was very clean, thoughtfully appointed and well located. A perfect apartment for our  short visit to NYC. Highly recommended!\", \"Fantastic apartment on the Upper East Side, perfect for a couple spending a few days in NY. Great location only a couple of minutes from the subway station, really convenient! Apartment itself is beautifully renovated, sparkling clean, modern and comfortable, supplied with everything you need to feel at home away from home, also has the most insanely comfortable bed I\\u2019ve ever slept in!

Spectacular bed, remarkably quiet. Had a harder time this trip finding a place that was not a multi- story walk-up\\u2014 this place is a breeze (one flight only!) Bathroom and kitchen spotless, new, modern. Washer & dryer = unexpected bonus. Spacious closet and drawer space! 2.5 blocks from 6 train. Would highly recommend.\", \"Anthony responds very quickly and was a great host!\", \"Great place & perfect location! Thanks, Anthony!\", \"Anthony's apartment offers great value with its location, size and stylish design. Given its competitive price, decent design and ample space, it is easily an attractive value option for a couple to enjoy a short stay in Manhattan.<br/>It has an excellent location as it was near to the Tramway station to Roosevelt Island and it is only 15 mins of walking away from 5th avenue and central park. Subway is only two blocks away. The open kitchen has all kinds of appliance s you need if you enjoy cooking. The big brownish sofa gives the house a stylish yet comfortable touch.<br/>However, we encountered a small issue during our stay as we found no shower gel or shampoo in the toilet. While our communication with Anthony is not as smooth and enjoyable as we expected, he offered some refund as reimbursement of our expense on bathing items which is a surprising and kind gesture from Anthony.<br/>A further point to note is the apartment is located on 2nd floor and you need to take stairs to the apartment. Only one of the windows of the bedroom is double layered, meaning that the bedroom may not be dark enough for some guests at night.<br/>Anyway, with some refinement, I am sure Anthony's apartment will continue to be an attractive and valuable airbnb option in NYC! It is definitely value for money! Highly recommended!\", \"Place was great and Anthony was a wonderful host.

The Apartment is clean and features  a full kitchen complete with cookware, very beautiful dishes and a glass cooktop. We made breakfast each day and that certainly helped lower the food bill. <br/>I just want to take a moment and just applaud the bed. This is one of the most comfortable beds I have ever had in an AirBNB. The down comforter with the amazing mattress was just perfect. This apartment does a great job of masking a lot of the city noise, but it is NY, so I mean, you will hear some sounds so if you are sensitive bring earplugs. <br/>The TV was perfect and has Netflix etc preloaded, so each day we were happy to come home and unwind in our living room and hit the hay. <br/>Anthony is a super communicator.

Lots of great shops and restaurants to walk to and one block to the subway.  Elizabeth and Noel greeted us in person and have clearly invested  their hearts into this quirky old place.  Agree with the reviewers that the full strength shower is an undersold feature and the space is more impressive in person than in photos.  Lots of room to stretch out.- unusual for Brooklyn.  Beds are comfy, plenty of extra blankets, and kitchen is well appointed.  We had a fairy tale Christmas experience here that our family will remember forever.\", \"I booked this Airbnb for my mom and sister to stay during the thanksgiving holiday as I live around the corner. It is absolutely stunning and in an incredible location. Elizabeth and Noel are wonderful hosts and made everything so easy for my family. I will definitely book again for visitors in the future!\", \"Very nice stay.  Great location in a safe neighborhood.\", \"This is a really beautifully done place. Full of interesting art and furniture. Great to walk around Greenpoint. Very close to subway into Manhattan.\", \"Amazing stay! Highly recommended!\", \"Elizabeth and Noel are fantastic hosts. This apartment is right in the heart of Greenpoint and all it\\u2019s great bars and restaurants and less than a block from the G train.  Apartment itself is really large, the pictures don\\u2019t do this place justice. The second time I\\u2019ve stayed here and without a doubt I will be back.\", \"Elizabeth\\u2019s place is super cool and spacious, great location and her communication was excellent throughout. Would definitely stay again if we\\u2019re in the area.\", \"Very disappointing... Communicating with the hosts was difficult, the first night I was not able to reach anyone before check-in and had to stay somewhere else. The following night the keys I was given did not work on the door and after calling the hosts several times I had to call and pay a locksmith to let me into the building. Noel was extremely rude to me at both check-in and after the locksmith ordeal and made me feel unsafe staying there, so I did not. Afterwards I received many antagonizing texts from him making up statements about my stay and the host would not process a refund for my stay so I had to cancel the charge via my credit card company. Yes the pictures look cool, but I do NOT recommend staying here at all. Absolutely disrespectful hosts that made my trip to Brooklynn a nightmare.\", \"Incredible place in a fantastic location.  A true gem and definitely a rare find.  My husband I were in the city for a wedding and stayed for 5 nights.  It's a large, roomy, and very comfortable loft space full of historic charm and great art.  The place just exudes a New York Cool vibe.  Neighborhood was quieter than we had expected yet full of great restaurants and shops and provided easy access to everything and everywhere.  The beds were comfortable (we used both because we're used to a King and I'm a bed hog) and the furniture and furnishings were all very nice.  The patio and outdoor shower are ridiculously good.  The bathroom is under-featured in the listing and was a very welcome surprise with its mop sink (best bathroom sink ever) and overhead firehouse strength showerhead.  A few things could have been cleaner, hence my 1-star deduction, but overall, we loved our Firehouse stay and experience and are hoping it is available the next time we are the city.  Elizabeth and Noel are gracious hosts and highly responsive and communicative.  If you are reading reviews and trying to decide if you should book this place, just do it - you won't regret it.  Based on the sharing of Airbnb photos amongst the wedding party (all out of state except for the bride and groom), I got appointed as everyone's booking agent because this place was several orders of magnitude better than any of theirs.\", \"Elizabeth\\u2019s place is in a perfect location in walking distance to awesome bars and restaurants. Very clean and has everything you need. Elizabeth was also very helpful, available at all times whenever I had any questions. Totally recommend it.\", \"Great location and apartment, it was perfect!\", \"Elizabeth's place gives you a great opportunity to \\\"live local\\\". When you close the door, you'll love how quiet the space is. The little patio space was delightful! Elizabeth was a pleasure to deal with. She had a wonderful and much appreciated \\\"welcome\\\" treat with wine, when I arrived.\", \"Spacious, elegant, historic apartment on a quiet street in Greenpoint. A really enjoyable place to find peace and quiet but still be able to access what Brooklyn has to offer.\", \"Amazing place in the heart of Greenpoint\\u2026\", \"The firehouse is so so so very special.  The history of it is amazing, the layout is perfect and the location couldn\\u2019t be better.  We had a wonderful trip and look forward to coming back and staying again soon!  Thank you for opening up your incredible home!\", \"Enjoyed our stay in this historic gem, located on a lovely street with easy access everywhere.  We enjoyed the large space, interesting artwork, private outdoor shower and very cool outdoor patio. Our hosts were lovely and very responsive. Recommend this space.\", \"Extremely impressed overall. The photos don\\u2019t do the firehouse true justice as it\\u2019s one of the more unique places I\\u2019ve stayed in. Spacious, comfortable and eclectically decorated. Elizabeth was a great host. Will be back !\", \"This place is great and pretty much exactly as it seems in the listing. Very large, comfortable, and flexible space with lots of unique charm and history. It's on a quiet street in an amazing neighborhood and Elizabeth was super responsive and accommodating. Would definitely stay here again!\", \"Great location near subways and shopping. The space is large with tall ceilings and interesting art. The backyard is another cool feature. Elizabeth was welcoming and responsive. We would stay there again without reservation.\", \"The Firehouse is a unique and fun space. Elizabeth and Noel are great hosts, making sure we had everything we needed throughout our stay with them. The wine and cheese were a lovely touch. We really enjoyed our stay here and would recommend to anyone looking for something cool in the Greenpoint area. Close to great restaurants, supermarkets and the metro. We really do love the Greenpoint neighborhood.\", \"Excellent stay. So much character, spacious and convenient location for me. Would absolutely recommend and would stay again. Hard to find a place like this.\", \"We had an awesome stay at Elizabeth and Noel's place.  The neighborhood is great, the place is huge (hard to come by in NYC) and totally unique and cool.  Elizabeth and Noel were the best hosts with personal touches of wine and snacks...it was the perfect trip and we'll definitely be back.\", \"The Firehouse is a great place to stay and Elizabeth and Noel are truly great hosts.  The firehouse is unique and quirky and in a great neighbourhood.  We would not hesitate to stay here again.\", \"This is one of my favorite places I\\u2019ve stayed in and the hosts were beyond great. I can\\u2019t recommend it enough for NYC trips. I will be checking it before anywhere else when booking trips to nyc in the future\", \"An amazing space with a gracious host.\", \"Wonderful place hosted by incredible people! Huge find in the heart of Brooklyn!\", \"A fun and unique experience in Greenpoint!  Elizabeth greeted us there to show the place and left treats for us to enjoy.  The firehouse has such charm and the art throughout show the fun they have had creating this special space.  The garden is a delight!  It offers everything you need for a comfortable and fun visit to a great neighborhood.  Communication was easy - and timely, with helpful checkins during our stay.\", \"Noel and Elizabeth were great hosts, the place was just as described. The firehouse had a great eclectic vibe with lots of treasures and gems to observe, also extremely close to a subway station if you\\u2019re heading anywhere in the city. Greenpoint is a fantastic neighbor with local foods and fun open air bars with great people to converse with. The late night pizza down the street was probably some of the best I have ever had, defiantly go with the Pepperoni with hot honey if you get a chance. Overall we would definitely stay again.\", \"Elizabeth and Noel were great hosts.  The apartment is fantastic, very cool space with lots of original features.

The place itself is also delightful\", \"A gracious host; a clean, comfortable space in a really good location.\", \"Expect a welcoming host that wants to be sure you stay exceeds your expectations\", \"Lili's place was great!  Location was convenient to shopping, dining and transportation.  The check-in process was seamless and communication with Lili was very prompt.  Quiet wooded location was very peaceful. Will definitely stay here again!\", \"Cute, great place with a homey feel! Lili is great and the whole process was seamless.\", \"Lili's apartment was a wonderful stay in a nice and safe neighborhood. The bed was comfortable and the space was clean. We would definitely stay here again!\", \"Warm, gracious host. Great location and quiet neighborhood. We will return.\", \"Lili\\u2019s place is wonderful and larger than I anticipated. I stayed the night before for an interview at North Shore hospital which is 5 min away. Great to have guaranteed parking on the driveway and my own separate space for the night since I wasn\\u2019t sure when I would get in. Check in was very easy. The shower was hot, and all kitchen amenities were available. Bed was comfy and there were extra blankets in the closet as well as an adjustable heat/AC unit. Only issue I really had was when I was coming in the street was quite dark and I couldn\\u2019t see the house numbers and had to rely heavily on google maps to let me know I was in the right driveway. Overall, would highly recommend staying here, it would be great for  traveling alone or for a couple or small group staying for a few nights.\", \"Clean, simple, relaxing place to get a good night's rest when traveling on Long Island. The french press and coffee were much appreciated.\", \"FECES on sheet and blanket. Bathroom mirror was dirty. And worst, the owner walked in hours after we had signed in. HORRIBLE experience.  We have asked for a refund.\", \"This was my first Airbnb and Lili exceeded my expectations. The place was clean, beautiful and spacious. It was also very peaceful and a 15 minute walk to the train station and shops. I would definitely stay again \\u2665\\ufe0f\", \"CLEAN & BRIGHT <br/>I needed a reasonable place to stay w/my daughter & small dog, for several days while the wood floors in my newly purchased home were being refinished. This place fit the bill! While not fancy, the space was clean, bright, private & adequate for our purposes. Parking was included, the king sized bed was in good shape & comfortable, the HVAC system worked well & we had no hot water issue. The neighborhood is safe, quiet & convenient to both the LIRR into Manhattan & all the North Shore of Long Island has to offer. THANKS Lili!\", \"Just as advertised! Very clean, quiet, and a great location. Thank you!\", \"Very close to train in a quiet pretty neighborhood. Place was clean overall a nice studio. Nice big TV also.\", \"Lilli's Airbnb is so clean and comfortable. The location is so beautiful, especially in the fall. All appliances and the tv were easy to work. I would definitely stay at this location again and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to stay in Great Neck!\", \"Great place for a quick stay in the Great Neck. Host was very nice and friendly and very accommodating. Very spacious and clean with a brand new TV!\", \"What you see is what you get.\", \"Everything was great except for the tv that didn\\u2019t work. I would stay there again. Great location\", \"This is a great oasis\\u2014comfortable, clean, lovely hostess. I\\u2019d highly recommend.\", \"Thank you Lili for hosting us! Everything was perfect for us . We had an issue with the tv but that doesn\\u2019t affect the overall experience:) would recommend!\", \"Lili\\u2019s place was perfect for my couple of nights needs. Very peaceful and private and Lili was extremely helpful.\", \"Lili was super accommodating! The space is decorated so nicely and was very clean. Would stay here again!\", \"Lili\\u2019s attached suite to her home is an incredible deal in a clean, safe neighborhood perfectly situated between Queens and Nassau County, LI. During my honeymoon I needed a place that allowed large dogs, and I truly appreciated Lili allowing my extra large German Shepherd to stay with us. I especially appreciated having a full size refrigerator, microwave and kitchen sink!\", \"Lili is a phenomenal host, she\\u2019s very inviting and warm and the home is in a wonderful area of Long Island that had a quiet neighborhood feel while being adjacent to the LIRR and close to main roads. We will actually be staying with her again on our return trip because it is such a great value!\", \"A quiet location, near but not right in the center of Great Neck.  Sadly, I was in town for a family funeral . Lily\\u2019s studio was private, quiet and peaceful , which really was helpful during a challenging time.  Lily and her husband were terrific about easy communication and follow-up, but also available if there were any concerns. I can see why this studio is often booked and was lucky to find it so last minute.\", \"Very clean and great location.\", \"Great location in a quaint little neighborhood.  Felt completely safe walking to train station at all hours.  About 15 minute walk to downtown Great Neck and train.  Great space with everything you might need.  Fast responses to questions.  Only downside was the hot water was luke warm at best and it took your breath away getting into the shower.  I got used to it but my wife could not.  Response to my question was they replaced the HWH and it should be OK.  Maybe hot to one is cold to another?  Overall I would stay again (but my wife would not).\", \"Nice spot!\", \"My boyfriend and I spent the summer living in Lili's studio and had a great experience. The space is large, and is in a safe and quiet neighborhood. It's only a 15 minute walk from the train station and downtown area of Great Neck. Lili and her family were very accommodating to our needs, friendly, and  respectful... they even installed an air conditioner per our request. I definitely recommend staying here if you ever find yourself in Great Neck!\", \"Great place super clean\", \"Great location for people working in or around Northwell! Easy to access via car and Uber\\u2019s. And with plenty of restaurants nearby to hit up after work!\", \"The space was beautiful and modern.

Good kitchen. Lots of lovely beds and good bathrooms. Enjoyed learning to use the bus and found the subway convenient too. We took johns suggestion and bought the weekly pass. Thanks for your hospitality. John was very responsive when there was a glitch getting in the front door and we were grateful and impressed!\", \"John and his apartment were great. It was a big space and perfect for my group of friends to get together for a weekend. The kitchen is clean and well stocked, and offered additional space to hang out in addition to the living room. The beds were super comfortable as well. One toilet was a bit slow to flush and one shower took a little time to warm up, but those are my only complaints and they were super minor. I would highly recommend staying here.\", \"A few suggestions- would appreciate hand towels (5), extra blankets for each bed. Toilet in shower bathroom had broken seat hinge, so we didn\\u2019t use it. Toilet in bathtub bathroom ran a lot after flushing (faulty valve=high water bill). Two of the dining chairs were broken & should be removed. Tiny ramp to kitchen is a tripping danger. All of us tripped at least once so we finally put the red chair there to prevent us from bearing left & tripping. Could not locate thermostat anywhere. Was cold inside the last day. No dishwasher pellets so we hand washed the dishes.  We liked the roominess of the living /dining/kitchen areas. Very clean. Thank you!\", \"Great stay\", \"Such an incredible host! He was clear, communicative, helpful, and the space was beautiful!\", \"Solid place, clean and quiet. Thanks, John!\", \"Beautiful spot. I had my pro esports team stay here for a lan event. They loved the spot. Highly recommend.\", \"John communicated well and the place was well located.  It's very sparse in terms of decor and amenities. John was very clear that it is up two flights of stairs but note that the stairs are old and narrow so if you have older guests or anyone with mobility issues you need to be aware of that. If it weren't so expensive I would have rated it higher, I just felt like the value wasn't there for the price we paid. That said, it worked out well as a central location for a family wedding and it is in a great spot for access to restaurants, parks, transport, and morning bagels.\", \"Great spot for a big group. Comfy beds, lots of space, great location.\", \"Nice space, great locations, clear and communicative host!\", \"Great location, very clean, and was able to accommodate multiple adults. We couldn\\u2019t have asked for anything better!\", \"Im afraid I would not stay here again.  The pictures do not accurately depict the property.  It is quite worn down and is set up with the bare minimum, which was not enough to house a family of 6 cooking at home for a week.  Simply far too expensive for the quality you are getting.\", \"Beautiful and chic apartment with very roomy living room and kitchen/dining room for spending time together. In a cool neighborhood with lots of shops, cafes, etc. Comfortable beds and modern decor.\", \"Huge place. Great location. Great communication. A little pricey but it\\u2019s NYC.\", \"Nice walk up in Brooklyn. Great location. Place was super clean and spacious. No frills but perfect for our group. John is very responsive and helpful. Would absolutely stay there again.\", \"Great stay for a big group!\", \"John was responsive to our request to help accommodate our extended family which included 4 kids under 3.  Would be nice to have smart TV capability for the kids and some extra fans for the bedrooms as the AC units are only on kitchen and living room area. But other than that we had everything we needed!\", \"Great location near Fort Greene park if you are looking for ~8 people for a getaway!\", \"Great place!<br/>Close to the city and great spots.<br/>Very spacious and well taken care of.<br/>It is on the 3rd floor so its difficult if you have someone in your group with disabilities.<br/>Lighting in the hallways and stairs is almost non existent at night, that could be improved.<br/>but overall great experience!\", \"Great location and perfect for a group! Highly recommend!\", \"Easy check in, clean place, good set up for a small family/ group. Good location too.\", \"Great location in brooklyn that can't be beat!\", \"The place was very nice and John made everything super easy! The place is exactly as described, very clean and spacious.

John was also very prompt in communicating and made checkin and checkout a breeze.\", \"The apartment was great with space for all of us (12).  The location was lovely with all sorts of restaurants right around the corner, and Fort Greene Park in easy walking distance.<br/>Thank you!\", \"John was responsive and accommodating, we had 5 people there and it was a good experience. There was plenty of space for us to spread out, which is rare for a place in New York for that many people.\", \"The flat is great. Huge and in a great location. Easy walk to all the great restaurants on and around Dekalb and very close to everything on Myrtle. We stayed for four weeks and loved it. We would definitely stay again.\", \"I will start off by stayin, this was prob one of the worst Airbnb experiences I have ever had.<br/>We paid a lot to stay at his place for 3 nights 4th of July weekend and he was entirely unprepared. Between the stained towels, 2 trash cans for the entire home it was just very uncomfortable. Initially he tried to get service personnel to fix the wifi, but then he violated privacy rights when I specifically told him I did not want ppl in the house when I\\u2019m not there due to my expensive personal belongings still there. John owns the entire 3 levels of the condo so he watches his ring camera consistently and Alerted me often when I had a few guest over for 4th of July. I could say more but I will leave it at that. I don\\u2019t recommend this place.\", \"John\\u2019s place is a great bang for your buck! Close to transportation, stores, resturants in a super friendly safe neighborhood. Parking is also available for a nominal fee. <br/>John is an flexible attentive host to assist with any issue.\", \"John\\u2019s home is in an amazing location. It is near everything you could want or need in Brooklyn. A stones throw away from great shopping and restaurants. Check in is easy and accurate and John is very communicative when you have questions.\", \"John's place was easy to find and John was very communicative. However, I had a lot of little issues during my stay. The door code John provided was incorrect, as was the WiFi info. In addition, the smoke alarms were chirping when I arrived and John dispatched someone to disconnect them. And then in the morning the heat was not working. As I mentioned, John was quick to respond and remedied all the issues, but seems like there needs to be a bit more upkeep on the building and a little more organization on the host side. I did notice he owns about 7 properties on AirBnB. Overall, the space was clean and spacious. But as a warning, there is nothing outside of hand soap at this place.\", \"Johns place was perfect for a big group. We had a last min cancellation and booked for 12 people 3 days before. He is quick to respond and extremely helpful. The apartment itself was exactly as advertised. Amazing space in a great neighborhood! Would definitely recommend and return!\", \"I really enjoyed my stay! John was very accommodating and a swift communicator. The home entrance was very easy to navigate and greatly located and the apartment was lovely. I\\u2019d definitely recommend!\", \"My third time here and I will continually be vetting this place for my NY stays.\", \"Great host ! The place looks a bit different than the pictures. Everything is very used ( the towels were literally ripped) heating issue never got solved either and it was cold... The code the host gave us at first didn\\u2019t t work but he was good on communicating and helping us with the issues but still the pictures don\\u2019t match reality much...\", \"The reviews of this place are spot on.  Great location, great apartment, very clean, great common spaces.  The beds were very comfortable.  We had a minor issue with the lock when we first got there and John fixed it right away.  We will definitely rent again.\", \"Beautiful apartment in a phenomenal location with the best host!\", \"Good experience. A lot of noise complaints though. <br/>Place is good, spacious. <br/>Accessible to everything.\", \"Great place. Very clean, spacious and homey. We loved our stay and the communication was great. Highly recommended!\", \"Highly recommend. Very spacious and stylish. We had a great stay\", \"Fantastic place, perfectly placed.  Everything was as described and communication / check-in was a piece of cake. Highly recommend.\", \"John was super responsive for my last-minute booking when our original host cancelled. His place was great for my family of 5. Nice amount of space, super clean, and great location.\", \"Good location and eatery right on the corner just steps away\", \"Very clean with everything we needed in the unit! John responds quickly and checking in is very easy. <br/>The location has everything we needed around it. You need to take a bus to the subway station if you want to get to Manhattan - took us 45 min to get where we wanted in lower Manhattan (FiDi) in the mornings.\", \"Our family had plenty of space to spread out during our stay, and enjoyed getting to know the Clinton Hill neighborhood. The area offered lots of dining options nearby as well as parks for the kids. We had a few issues with the door lock, the toaster and the shower once, but John was quick to respond and fix the issues. Any large family or group traveling to Brooklyn/NYC would be very happy here.\", \"Great place to stay! I recommend. \", \"John\\u2019s place was perfect for our group of 9. Plenty of comfortable sleeping space and a ton of common space to hang around while not out and about in the city! Great area- lots of little restaurants and bars to try just around the corner! \", \"Great location and the accommodations were excellent. John was very proactive in making sure we had everything we needed.  The local information he provided helped us navigate New York.  \", \"Our family of 8 (grownups and kids) had a FABULOUS weekend based at John's Brooklyn flat. We loved that it was clean and well kept. We opted to have our food delivered from highly rated restaurants, and that worked perfectly. The dining table was big enough for all of us, and the kitchen was equipped with plenty of dishes and utensils.<br/>When we had a question and messaged John, he responded almost immediately! We really appreciated that.<br/>This place is a sure thing: clean, well kept, and comfortable. We got exactly what I expected -- a fantastic space. Thanks, John!\", \"Beautiful house. Great located. Easy to check in and out. Some hiccups but I am confident John will fix those things.\", \"As advertised, super clean. Super host. Should note the stairs.\", \"John's home was in a great location to restaurants and downtown Brooklyn. The place was cute and we enjoyed our stay.\", \"Beautiful apartment, had a great stay. Lots of space. Quick responses from john. Would definitely recommend!\", \"Beautiful home in a truly excellent location. Easy access to great restaurants and the G is about a 10 minute walk. We had a little trouble getting in with the door codes upon arrival but John responded immediately and we were inside within 5 minutes. Couldn't be happier with John and the response times; he was all over it for us. The place itself is perfect for a larger group; we were 6 and felt very comfortable. Can't give enough thanks to John for hosting, we had a wonderful time!\", \"The space is exactly as pictured. All of my guests had a wonderful time and were very happy with the sleeping arrangements. John\\u2019s place has a hotel like vibe. Great for a large group.\", \"John was able to accommodate a large group of us for a work gathering - thank you!\", \"Great space for the price and location.\", \"John\\u2019s place is awesome! Stylish roomy well located. Our 4 kids really enjoyed it and the location was awesome. Connecticut Muffin is great by the way. John was super helpful!\", \"We had a great time at John's apartment!  It was perfect for our group of 8 - plenty of room for all, the place was very clean, check-in was incredibly easy, and John was quick to respond to all questions!! Would go back.\", \"The place is as described. Spacious and clean with close stores and restaurants. The 5pm Check-in and no subways being close could dampen your experience, depending on your needs.\", \"This was my second time in this apartment/home. I will continually seek John's place as long as it is available. I love the location, the price, and customer service provided by John. Immediate response when thing go awry...its another A+ experience.\", \"John was so amazing and accommodating to all of our requests. He was timely in responding to all of our questions and concerns and made sure we knew everything we needed to navigate the home. With the personalized keyless entry codes, the building was super safe and the neighbours were very friendly and also helpful when we showed up looking for the house. John had everything we needed to stay comfortably during our trip. I would definitely stay with him again.\", \"Great spot in Brooklyn with easy access to Manhattan. John was really responsive, and the apartment is big, clean, and exactly like the pictures. The area in Brooklyn is safe and has everything you need for dining, groceries and some great bagels - also nice and quiet at night.<br/>A great spot and we will definitely be back.\", \"This is the best place to stay in Brooklyn. Super clean nice apartment, if this is available you need to book it immediately. Amazing!\", \"Great place! Location was perfect and the hospitality was awesome.\", \"This was my first experience with airbnb and this place exceeded our group's expectations. There were six of us and we could have easily fit a few more people for an even cheaper stay and still have plenty of room. Would definitely recommend!\", \"Perfect place for a girls' weekend! John's place was spacious, super clean, modern and close to many wonderful eateries and coffee shops. Bright and cheery and very quiet.

Gorgeous and unique with exposed brick and beams, large bedrooms and two bathrooms make this the perfect stay. The main street is a 2 minute walk away and has plenty of unique restaurants and coffee shops. Close enough to Manhattan that you can spend the day and take a short subway or cab back. John was super responsive, check in process is seamless, and everything was fantastic. Thanks again for the hospitality and can't wait to return!\", \"Very nice and clean place with modern decor. Pictures are accurate. John was very helpful with addressing any questions and issues that arose\", \"Huge modern apartment in a great location!

Spacious and centrally located, beat spot to stay in clinton hill period\", \"Great location, about a 10 min walk to trains, plenty of restaurants, bars and lounges.  And the apartment was phenomenal!  Spacious, clean, and a true Brooklyn brownstone experience with nice upgrades.  Me and my colleagues loved the space and were able to work and unwind in this lovely, tastefully decorated apt.  I highly recommend Johns place!\", \"We were complicated -- I booked the apartment for eight family members arriving in three groups from London for a wedding, and I never saw the apartment myself.   But John lived up to his excellent reputation, everyone said that the apartment was spacious, very well equipped, and -- fortunately because the weather was unusually warm and humid -- had air conditioning that worked perfectly!   Highly recommended, and we send our thanks to John.\", \"Very spacious apt. and close to bars/restaurants. Easy ride into Manhattan. Definitely recommend this place for large parties.\", \"John's flat is accurately portrayed in his photos. The area was safe and the building was easy to access with a smart lock. There is a bodega, bars, restaurants, and other stores right outside the building.<br/>The flat was wonderful and can definitely fit more people (3 queen sized beds, 1 single bed, 1 futon, and a couch). However, one a/c unit in the room did not work for us during our stay. But overall, house rules were clearly stated and everything else was great.\", \"The place was as advertised with good bedrooms / bathrooms and a large kitchen as well as a large common area. It could easily accommodate a couple people on the couches if needed! <br/>John was very responsive and easy to arrange getting in etc. <br/>Great stay!\", \"The stay was great. We were there for a music festival in Brooklyn and the location was awesome. Pretty much whatever you need is a block or too away whether thats food, a convenient store, liquor store, Starbucks, etc. The G train is also not too far, about a 10 min walk from the apartment. The apartment itself was great for our group. The setup was great and the place was pretty clean. John was also available for any questions we had which was great.\", \"Great place. John is super responsive. Would stay again.\", \"Great host and great place to stay anytime you're in NY. The place has everything you need and location, location, location. The host was very prompt in responding to any inquiry we had. Definitely recommend!!! \", \"John's place was just as described. It was a beautiful place for myself and 4 of my girlfriends to have a great girls trip. John was more than helpful in helping us navigate the city. From restaurant suggestions to helping us get from the city to the house on the subway. He was also very accommodating in helping us store our luggage before and after check in and check out times. Thanks so much John!\", \"John's place was clean spacious and in a very good location.  Close to transportation and restaurants.  We would consider his place on our next trip.  <br/>Overall, it was all good.  Thanks John.\", \"John was a great host. His communication was quick and he was flexible with our changes. The photos he provided were accurate and the place is great for groups. Lots of comfortable beds! Great location! Would definitely stay again.\", \"Had a great stay for four nights, apt was good and ready upon arrival and communication with John was always swift and accurate.

For the rest it was all in the house. Thanks and happy to go back!!\", \"Beautiful apartment for a great stay.  Lots of room for multiple guests and a nice sized kitchen and living room.  John is incredibly helpful and responsive.  You'll enjoy your stay!\", \"very nice flat and a good availibility from john\", \"I was charged with planning a trip for 10 of my girlfriends and they all wanted to visit New York.  I live in Brooklyn so this task was perfect for me. I booked John's Clinton Hill listing and it looked just like the pictures. My guests arrived at different times so having a key code on the door as opposed to an actual key made it much easier for everyone to move about and not alter our schedules to let people into the building as they sporadically arrived.There were plenty of towels for my guests, coffee available in the kitchen, and lots of space for us all to just hang out. As we didn't have cars the apartment's proximity to restaurants and markets made satisfying a diverse array of cravings pretty easy.  The only con I have is the access to the train...we would have liked being closer to popular train lines. We used Ubers for most of the weekend. <br/>Overall great experience. \", \"John's place is wonderful. Very well located with everything you need nearby (even a 24/7 grocery store 50 meters away). Apartment was very clean and as described. Kitchen fully functional. Metro to Manhattan is about 15 minutes away passing through Fort Green park. John is very responsive. We had a great time. Thank you!\", \"Exceptional home! Situated perfectly within the Clinton Hill area of Brooklyn with so much to see and do within walking distance. The home was beautiful and served our large families needs with ease. I would highly recommend a stay at Johns place! \", \"John was super quick to answer any questions we had both prior to and during our stay. The flat was exactly as described in the pictures. The place was super clean and the beds very comfortable. <br/>The subway is on walking distance but not too close so be prepared to catch an Uber ride on rainy days or if you're in a hurry. There are also plenty of good and affordable restaurants within walking distance. <br/>We highly recommend this flat for everyone visiting NY!\", \"So far the best airbnb place I've stayed at. We took a taxi from the airport (Newark), which took about an hour. We only had to call John upon arrival and it was easy to check in. His place is perfect if you're a group of students (like us), family etc. It was clean and we had everything we needed for our week-long stay. It was easy to cook and despite filling up every bed, there was enough space for everyone. John was also very helpful and easy to contact. The only thing to mention is that we were unable to turn down the heating in the living-room, so it got a little too warm, and by opening the window we let the noise from the street in during the night.<br/>The apartment is about a five-ten minute walk to the nearest subway station, so we got around Brooklyn and Manhattan without much trouble. Since we still had some hours to kill after check-out before leaving for the airport, we took the subway to Penn Station and left our bags at a short-term storage a few minutes away from the train station. John offered a late check-out, but that was 50 dollars an hour to the storage's 10 dollars per bag.<br/>Overall the apartment was very comfortable, there was a lot of room for flexibility and we had a great stay. Highly recommended!\", \"We have just completed 4 rather hectic days in NY trying to take in as much as possible.  It was a delight to come home to our accommodation here in Clinton Hill each night to rest up ready for the next day.  Would highly recommend this accommodation to anyone (there were 6 of us) visiting NY.\", \"Jonh's place was great, the decor is very morden, the bed is comfortable, the kitchen is stock with all the supply you need, location is great, there is the grocery store right next to the place, and a bunch of restaurant around. i would recommend to stay at his place when you visit NY. \", \"Me and my family loved John's place, we stayed there for 10 days, and everything was very organized and clean. We found it very easy to move around the city and locate the subway. The house is very confortable and the appliances are new, John is a very courteous host, and very helpful with everything we needed.<br/>The only thing me and my family forgot to ask was about the stairs, as we were with a lot of luggage, it was a bit difficult to go to the 3rd floor with the bags, since the stais are really narrow.<br/>All the rooms were confortable, had heaters and an amazing kitchen. We had a very good experience on John's place.\", \"The apartment was great. Very clean and comfortable. It was spacious. The kitchen and the living room were great for a group to hang out. The neighborhood was great as well. Close to Manhattan. Many bars and restaurants nearby.\", \"John's place is great! Spacious, well-stocked and clean. He was very responsive and helpful. We would definitely stay at this condo again. \", \"Perfect\", \"John's home was exactly what we were looking for in a stay in NYC. Close to transit but in a residential area and a beautifully renovated apartment.\", \"This place is big. Having the living room on one end of the long hall and kitchen at the other makes the space versatile and usable for larger groups. The two bathrooms made it easy for our group of 7 to stay comfortable. Beds are great. Very clean. Host is on top of details and fast to reply. \", \"Great Value.  The keypad system is great and John was always very responsive!\", \"This is a great area in Brooklyn to stay. Close to shops , transport, Restaurants. The apartment is spacious and well kept . John a fantastic host . The apartment was spotless and well stocked. I will stayed with my adult family 7 people and it was perfect . I would highly recommend John's apartment \", \"John was an outstanding host during our stay! As Floridians, we are not used to the cold weather we encounter during our stay. John wasted no time in adding extra warmth to our stay. \", \"I've stayed in a few AirBnB's now and this has to be the best by far. Great host (really good communication), fantastic apartment and ideal location if you don't want to stay in central Manhattan and want to experience a different side of NYC. <br/>The apartment itself was very clean, comfortable and everything you need for a short stay was provided. <br/>Immediately around the apartment there are a number of stores, cafes and places for you to eat and drink (check out Johns areaguide) - again ideal if you want to get out of Manhattan after a day of tourism. I would recommend saving time to travel up into Williamsburg (north east Brooklyn) there are even more cool places, shops and restaurants with really good vibes. Perfect for day or night. <br/>The commute into Manhattan varied depending on where you was going but I would say no commute exceeded an hour. Subway, metro and train lines are walkable from the apartment and vary between 10 - 20 minutes depending which line you need.  For an unlimited public transport weekly pass it is $31 and John was a great help in letting us know how to get this. <br/>It was clear to me and my family why John is a superhost and we would definitely return to use his apartment - hopefully sooner rather than later. <br/>Thanks John! \", \"The flat is very big and comfortable for many people. We have there in 7 for a whole week. Good connection to Manhattan by train. You can also use bus 54 just out of the door. Please consider 45 minutes to arrive in Manhattan downtown. <br/>The flat has an essential equipment. <br/>John has been always very reactive in case of questions. <br/>\", \"John was incredibly responsive and the apartment was great.  Everything was just as pictured, kitchen was well-equipped, and we loved having both the dining area and the family room sitting areas.  Beds were comfortable and everything was super clean.  We really liked the neighborhood.  There was a great small grocery store right around the corner (Mr. Coco) and a large nice Key Food 5 minutes away.  The Pratt Institute Sculpture Garden was a nice find also about 5 minutes away.\", \"If there is one thing I am a fan of, it is a quick turn around to a text or email. John literally would always reply within about 5-10 minutes of any message sent to him. He is extremely friendly, and the home is very comfortable and located in an easy location. Made the weekend experience one for the books!\", \"John is a great host who is very responsive and accommodating. For example, when I checked-in the keycode wasn't working, I called him and he picked up right away. He was really nice and apologetic about it, but it was no trouble at all! \", \"Having been to NYC many times before, we knew we wanted a more quite, safe secluded area and a large affordable apartment to come back to at the end of the day. Not something easily available on Manhattan, but here in Brooklyn, John\\u2019s place hits the spot. Apartment is as described both by John and other reviewers. Area is safe and has many eating-places and shops for food stock. What doesn\\u2019t get mentioned is that you can see the \\u2018Freedom Tower\\u2019 from the kitchen window! Best Mexican we had right around the corner at Los Pillitos. We took the \\u2018C line\\u2019 into town and must admit used yellow cabs to get back after a long day out. About $30 from Grand Central area. The Clinton Hill area has many local cabs but it\\u2019s a good idea to know the whereabouts of the address your going to. John is extremely accommodating and is the best host we have had (and we\\u2019ve had a few) Always quick to respond to your question despite time difference and can be on hand at site if required. We needed a new toaster and kettle. John arrived that evening with both. A first trip for my teenage children and they really enjoyed the experience, thanks John.\", \"We were a group of six and had a wonderful stay at Johns place. Although we had a small problem with our check in code John was very helpful and super responsive to all our needs. We would definitely recommend this place for exploring NYC while having a calm and cool retreat during your stay!\", \"John was the man in every aspect. He was super flexible with our schedule and hooked up the crucial parking spot for the ginormous band van from whence we could Lyft to all our gigs like gods among men. The pad itself is a true gem.. gorgeous, spacious, welcoming and modern, it is literally a stone's throw from all sorts of delicious spots and a short, beautiful walk to the subway station. Brooklyn is rad af, and Clinton Hill is the business. Highly recommended by Zigadoo Moneyclips. We will most definitely be back!!\", \"Meet with John, he is great, very welcoming and would do anything to help. The apartment is in a great location, with a great bar close and plenty of food and amenities within 100 yds. Despite its central locality it is incredibly quiet, so no night noises\", \"We stayed in John's apartment for a week while in New York for a wedding. It was everything we expected from the listing. Very comfortable with lots of space for our group of 8. It was great to have two separate areas to hang out - the kids could play and watch TV at one end of the apartment and the adults could be in the kitchen/dining area. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>The neighborhood is very nice, with everything you need. The Putnam Pub and Cooker pub/restaurant around the corner was nice and accommodated our group of 25 Irish family for dinner. Lots of good places to eat, Fort Greene Park down the road was good for running, playgrounds nearby and the area felt safe. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>Overall, an excellent experience, and John was very easy to deal with. We would definitely recommend the apartment and would stay there again. \", \"John\\u2019s place was a very nice place for us to stay during our visit in New York. Very good beds and, as the pictures promised, a large kitchen and living room. Perfect for us. We are a family from the Netherlands with two adult daughters and their boy-friends. The appartement was nearby the subway and we had a great time. By the way, whenever we had a question John responded immediately. Thank you John for making our stay in New York a wonderful time. \", \"John was a great host!\", \"John was an excellent host, very quick to respond to any questions we had.  Excellent guide book with some great restaurants recommended in the area. Brilliant apartment, lovely and spacious, just as shown in the photos and in a very nice location. Very clean on arrival. Silly as it sounds could do with bigger towels.\", \"The place looked just like the pictures, only bigger and better in person. We used all of the bedrooms and had plenty of room to quietly relax in the oversized kitchen & living area when not roaming the wonderful city.  John is a perfect host, very responsive to any questions we had.  \", \"John is a very nice, helpful and welcoming host. The listing description was perfect, accurate, just as described on Airbnb. I felt very safe in the neighborhood. The home was very clean, well stocked with toiletries and supplies that are needed throughout your day to day living. The neighborhood was very nice and clean considering a lot of other neighborhoods I have visited while in New York. \", \"Where do I begin? I celebrated my birthday with close friends (6 of us total) and when I first saw this place, I fell in love immediately. I live in NY but I'm not from NY so I was completely shocked by the size of the house. The pictures are true and accurate to how it is in person. It's almost like a house from The Real World. <br/>Everything was completely clean once we got there and John is easily accessible. My friends loved the spot, since we are actors/actresses, we made countless memories and recorded our trip. We actually called it our home away from home and John made us feel that way. <br/>The keyless keypad entrance is genius. There are a lot of places to visit and I for one, would recommend Soco for brunch. It was so delicious. <br/>This trip will go down in the books for me and staying here was definitely the best decision by far. The only regret I have is, I wish we would have washed the towels but every night we didn't get in until super late. I like to leave everything as clean and tidy as possible. He said we could just put them in the tub, but my plan was to wash and fold them. My apologies, John. But yes, book this place. It's amazing - the color and the decor is superb!<br/>Thank you, John!\", \"John was an awesome host! Super friendly, helpful, informative, and on point.  The place was really nice and clean with all the amenities that one would need.  Located in an area of Brooklyn that was lively and walking distance to stores and restaurants.  \", \"Thank you John for the wonderful stay in Brooklyn. I appreciated your restaurant recommendations in your guidebook and that you were very quick to respond to my emails. Your pad looked exactly like the pictures and was very clean and spacious. I travelled with my partner and two friends and we all had a great time. The street was very quiet at night, yet was conveniently located close to a great little grocery store and lots of restaurants. It was a great base for exploring Brooklyn and Manhattan as it was close to the subway. The air conditioning was great (especially given the heat outside). I also loved the bathrooms (the ceiling skylight in the shower was a nice touch). I loved the neighborhood and would definitely stay here again!\", \"This is an excellent space for a group of people. I held a small dinner here and the host had everything we could have needed as far as amenities go. It's a gorgeous, clean and comfortable stay in a great BK neighborhood with a ton to offer. Highly recommended!\", \"10 country mice to the city for a wedding!  Our ages ranged from 10 to 74.  The space was terrific. Everyone had a comfortable place to sleep with an air conditioner in each room. There was enough room that we weren't in each other's way. All 10 could gather either in the kitchen/dining area or living room when we wanted to be together. Travel into Manhattan was easy with subway within walking distance. Uber drivers also did not have trouble finding us.  Plenty of restaurants in the area and green grocer around the corner for when we wanted to have dinner \\\"at home\\\". A bank and drug store also near by.  Keypad entry meant we didn't have to worry about trading keys.  Family members came and went from early to late without disturbing others. The apartment is very quite and street noise is minimal. John, our host, responded to our requests immediately - always with a smile. We felt it was important to him that we enjoyed ourselves...and we did! We will recommend this space to any friends who travel to the big city.\", \"We came to celebrate 2 birthdays, a party of 7.  This apartment was amazing and easily accommodated us all.  It is huge and very comfortable.  There was everything you need, the beds were extremely comfortable.  You have to be in the lounge to get a good Wifi signal as it peters out in the kitchen.  The neighbourhood is very good and I would recommend John's Guidebook.  Especially good was the Myrtle Thai, which we tried twice, also tried Putnams (only 2 steps away), Johns Donut cafe and Mr Coco's for groceries.  John was especially helpful and quick to respond to our needs.  I definitely would recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to go to Manhatten or Brooklyn (which was good to visit too).  It felt very safe even at night.\", \"The photographs are true to life, but don\\u2019t really give you the sense of how huge the apartment is! The beds are very comfortable, AC worked really well. Great to have 2 bathrooms, there was always hot water.  Lots of clean towels, and coat hangers/hanging space. The whole place is lovely, modern with no clutter and it was spotlessly clean, no shoe policy helps to keep it that way.  There are 2 seats with shoe racks in the hall.  The keyless entry worked really well, as did the Wifi.  The apartment is on the top (2nd) floor of a really nice house, no lift but you wouldn\\u2019t expect one in this type of house.\\r<br/>The neighbourhood was great, very quiet in the apartment, and outside too.  Small shop next door and other grocery shops round the corner (24 hour it seemed), nice bars and restaurants, Myrtle Bagel shop, coffee shop and pharmacy all nearby. Two subway stations (Clinton/Washington Avenue) a short walk away \\u2013 G Line closest and also A-C a few more blocks away, easy access to Manhattan, particularly Soho, Chelsea, Greenwich Village & Williamsburg. The neighbourhood was quiet and had a very friendly and relaxed feel, some beautiful huge houses just down tree- lined Clinton Avenue.  It felt really safe.\\r<br/>We had a late evening flight (which became even later!) \\u2013 11am check out was fine for us as there is a store room to keep cases on the ground floor \\u2013 we had no problem picking up the luggage much later on.\\r<br/>No hesitation recommending this apartment \\u2013 it was fantastic.\", \"This apartment is absolutely amazing! Spacious, elegant and comfortable. John is a super host, so quick to respond, helps wherever he can and was very friendly when we met him. He even bought our kids some toys! We loved the power shower for us and the bath for the kids. Also kitchen is beautiful and ready to cook just about anything. The location was excellent, with multiple options for walking to different subway lines. We even did the walk to Brooklyn bridge with little kids, really not too far. We also thoroughly enjoyed exploring the area, parks, cafes, markets and bars are plentiful. Two families had the best week in New York largely due to this place. We all highly recommend this beautiful place.\", \"John was the most gracious of hosts. He was very accommodating and most eager to offer any recommendations for dinning/enjoying the  Clinton Hill area. The apartment was spotless, beds incredibly comfortable and there was great space for our family of six to spread out in. My 80 year old mom even commented on how comfortable the arrangement and beds were. The location is great for easy walking to all that Clinton Hill offers. We loved being an easy walk to Pratt Campus and many a great spot for noshing. Highly recommend!\", \"John, the host, was very positive and helpful. Every thing was as described. The apartment has been renovated in very tasteful way. We were 7 together, three couples and one single so that 4 bedrooms was great solution for us. There is a good restaurant around the corner, as well as grocery stores. For other shopping in Brooklyn it doesn't take long to get to Fulton street.\\r<br/>\", \"This condo, as great as the photos looked, was even better in person.  The accommodations were spacious and perfect for the 6 of us.  Very nicely appointed.  John, the host, met us upon arrival and helped carry our luggage up the 3 floors - thank you, John! He made up the two sofa beds for us as the six of us wanted out own space. He was very prompt at responding to questions and inquires.  We couldn't ask for a better host. He even had coffee for us which was a nice touch.  The neighborhood was fabulous.  We enjoyed Putnams, a restaurant a few doors down.  Yummy.  The walk to the subway was just a quick jaunt away.  It was fun to imagine we lived in this quaint neighborhood.  We would definitely recommend this place and would go back in a heartbeat.\", \"We, a family of four, had I great time visiting Brooklyn, not in the least because of the modern, clean and roomy apartment John has to offer. John is very helpful, resourceful and easy to reach. Clinton Hill is close to the subway and even better, it has a Citibike rental station right in front of the door! There are plenty of good restaurants and shops in the neighborhood. We absolutely recommend this place! Rob Beuse and Nicky Nicola, The Netherlands. \", \"We had a wonderful time in New York. The apartment of John was very comfortable, with lots of space. We liked the neighbourhood with the bakery, grocery and restaurant. Bus and subway were easy to reach. It was very easy to get in contact with John, he answered promptly to questions we had. Definitely a place to return to!\", \"We had a wonderful stay in the apartment which was just as described and equipped with everything we needed. John answered any queries very promptly. The keyless entry worked well, particularly as we came and went at different times, and we could not fault the comfort and cleanliness.\\r<br/>The location was good too, with a grocery, excellent bar/restaurant, bagel shop, coffee shop and even a pharmacy within a couple of minutes walk. The subway was a short walk away allowing easy access to Manhattan, Williamsburg, Prospect Park and elsewhere.

Very friendly and accessible.  Any time I needed to communicate with John he responded quickly.  The apartment is in a very lovely neighborhood with easy access to anything you might need.  Also within 3 blocks to the subway, which we used to go into Manhattan each day with no problem.  Apartment exactly what was depicted on site -- very roomy and neat and clean.  We loved staying here and would come back for sure.\", \"Renting out Johns apartment was an amazing experience . THE PICTURES DO NOT LIE!  The space is beautiful and spacious . John is very kind and welcoming and will be able to help you with anything you need . The area is very quiet . There are stores close to the apartment so you aren't going out of your way.

John's apartment was perfect for us.  It could accommodate a large group with ample private bedroom space and spacious common areas-a nicely appointed kitchen and large living room.

He was  extremely prompt in answering any queries and setting up entry codes early for the apartment so that we didn't have to worry about anything once our trip had started. Once we arrived we met John and wished we could have spent more time with him. He is a lovely happy man.He was good enough to change our sheets and towels mid week and has been really helpful when I left something in the apartment when we lwft. The apartment is lovely and well heated and ventilated. It is really big and we all had our own space being a family of four. It was so great to come back to the apartment after being out all day and feel totally relaxed and at home. We all enjoyed the huge living room and tv. The exposed brick walls and huge wooden ceiling beams are so full of character ... it made our NY experience very special. \\r<br/>There are also rental bikes outside which had we not been traveling with children would have definitely taken advantage of! The restaurant 2 doors down is lovely and the food store around the corner is fantastic for supplies. Thanks John, we had a ball \", \"A perfect spot for a group to share.  Plenty of room to enjoy and just hang out in between events for the weekend.  Enjoyed the neighborhood overall though would recommend ear plugs if you sleep with the windows open.  Very well decorated and comfortable. John was extremely helpful and available when needed both before and during the trip.  \", \"Great Apartment, better than my expectation!

Thank you very much!\", \"We enjoyed it very much being John's guests. He is a very nice and friendly host and has taken care of us. He even provided us with fresh towels and new bedclothes at the weekend. <br/>It is a very cozy and quite place in a save neighborhood and provides a lot of space for 4 people.  <br/>The only thing we realy missed was actually an espresso machine. We bought one for less in a kitchen store, since we like to drink fresh espresso. However you can take you breakfast at the corner. It serves good croissants and    tasty cakes. <br/>There are several subway stations not too far away in walking distance that brings you to Manhattan or Prospect Park area. But you could also check out the city bike station in front of the appartement.\", \"John's place was beautiful and in a great location. Communication was seamless, I would not hesitate to recommend staying here!\", \"Hi everyone, \\r<br/>\\r<br/>I can only agree with the previous guest. Johns apartment is a great place to stay and was perfect for our one week sight seeing tour in NYC.

Subway is a just a few minutes walking away and a citi bike station is directly located in front of the house (try it, it's pretty fun to explore the city by bike).\\r<br/>\\r<br/>John is a great host! You can always text him and he will get back to you within a couple of minutes.

Staying at his beautiful home made our trip so much more than we expected! It is super easy access to the city and also all that Brooklyn has to offer. We will definitely stay again. Thank you John for a lovely experience.\", \"This was the most perfect place to stay! Yes, the place is exactly as you see in the pictures \\u2013 even better. It's HUGE! I felt like I almost got lost in there in the beginning. The kitchen is twice  as big as a normal NYC-flat and on top of that there is the even bigger living room with flat screen TV and the three bedrooms, all of them really big as well. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>I came to New York with two colleagues and this was perfect for us. We had one bedroom each with huge closet space and a lot of clean towels. The two bathrooms both with shower and WC also made it easy for us getting ready on time in the morning. Very good for three girls...\\r<br/>\\r<br/>And John was the perfect host. When we came, John had made sure there were fresh fruit, crackers, cheese and chilled ros\\u00e9 waiting for us, and even two bouquets of fresh roses! Just wonderful. And through half of our stay, he even made sure to have our bed sheets changed for fresh ones, give us new towels, new fresh flowers and some new treats, without us even asking. Felt like a hotel. Too kind!\\r<br/>\\r<br/>The apartment is completely new with new furniture, super clean (no shoes allowed inside \\u2013 as a Swede I love that)  and has very effective air conditioning in each room which was appreciated! In the kitchen there were all the utensils you might need. The keyless system to get through the door is also very clever \\u2013 no worries about loosing keys or need to share one key between several guests. Also one super important thing: it was so quiet. The flat is on the top floor (two stairs, no lift) and we never heard a thing from either the street, the neighbors or each other. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>The place is within walking distance to Manhattan bridge or Brooklyn bridge and to walk from the doorstep to Manhattan/China town took us about 40mins. The G line is about a 5 min walk away (and there are bus stops all around) and there are several bars, caf\\u00e9s, restaurants and delis just around the corner to buy food and groceries. The neighborhood, Clinton hill, is one of my favorites, not as hipster or expensive as Williamsburg but instead with genuine good places to eat and shop, and super safe (of course), but very close to both Bushwick and Williamsburg. My favorite borough to stay in in Brooklyn for sure.  \\r<br/>\\r<br/>The host, John, always replied swiftly on messages and was very helpful and generous throughout. He always made sure we had everything. We could not have had a better host, I am so happy to have stayed at his place and would not hesitate one bit to come back again next year.  \\r<br/>\\r<br/>And last but not least: the wi-fi was also really good, a strong connection and never any problems.

We were able to leave our bags with the front desk after check out which was an added bonus!\", \"Great location.\", \"nice space!<br/>great location only about 3 blocks from subway station. <br/>space was clean and as large as you could hope for at this price point.<br/>bathrooms were well stocked with soap/shampoo and bodywash for our group of 5\", \"The location was perfect for us. Easy to get to the metro to ride uptown on the 2 and 3 which is usually closed at night so take the R train home. <br/>We loved that there was a free laundry on the 8th floor and an open terrace on the 7th. <br/>Things that can be improved- our room floors were very dirty, no ice, and there are no chairs other than a loveseat. The listing shows two other chairs. <br/>Other things to note- there isn't a coffee machine in the room or a table with chairs.\", \"We had a wonderful family gathering! The location is great!\", \"This was a very nice find. The hotel staff were, to a person, helpful and friendly. There was plenty of sleeping available for our party of eight. We wish there had been a dedicated couch in the living room, as the modular cushions were a good idea in theory but not particularly comfortable. However, the key feature is location: South Street Seaport nearby, five minutes to several subway lines, eight minutes to the Staten Island Ferry, twelve minutes to the Brooklyn Bridge.\", \"Amazing!

There is a parking garage across the street where we were able to park our cars for the entire duration.<br/>There is not enough place for 8 people to sit in the living area but we were ok since we were out and about for the entire trip.<br/>Overall it\\u2019s a great place to stay if you have a large party.\", \"Great stay if you want to be on Wall Street\", \"Convenient stay in a great location. We had everything we needed and communication was easy. Only thing I would like is more lamps in the rooms and a night stand.\", \"Amazing clean place. Good staff and security and great location and lots of space for 8 people. Living room is a bit small but the bedrooms are great.\", \"Very convenient residential hotel-style place. Friendly staff and comfortable rooms. Would stay there again.\", \"The place was great, and just like the pictures.  There is not a dining table, no matter what anyone tells you.  I asked Placemakr after reading through guests' comments and told there was a dining table in the apartment but there was not, it was in the common area/kitchen on the floor.  The only other issue I had was with parking; first I was told to come to the hotel to check in before going to the parking garage referred to me by Placemakr, but that wasn't necessary.  It complicated things but we were able to drop off our luggage to have it stored until we could check in.  Also, the parking garage referred, 84 Pearl Street, was awful.  They were mean and condescending and charged me $120 for 26 hours and 41 minutes, not the suggested rate of $50 that Placemakr said I would pay.  I will not drive next time, but I will stay here again.  The soaps in the shower were amazing.  The highlight of my stay!\", \"Great location, clean, comfortable and very nice people with great service attitude to welcome you!\", \"Simply the best.\", \"Clean, affordable, & a solid location!\", \"Great place to staff. Beautiful few of the water from my apartment. Also has awesome vibes in the building. Do recommend\\u2763\\ufe0f\", \"DO NOT STAY HERE! This place had no clean towels for 3 days after taking ours, saying we got clean towels every day...the air conditioners did not work and couldnt be fixed because they didnt have the parts, there were no clean dishes to replace the previously used dishes in the room, no paper towels. When I complained to AirBnb they erased ALL my messages to them and their acknowledgement of problems. Staff informed me the hotel was overbooked and they had minimal staff and did not know when they would receive towels, supplies etc. Stalled on the AC repairs. Have not responded to complaint through AirBNB for 3 weeks nor to me personally. Furniture was stained with fluids that were not food related.....violated all COVID protocols and cleanliness. WORST PLACE I have ever stayed. AirBNB is no help at all as they didnt respond for a full week after I filed a complaint within 72 hours. I have cancelled all other AirBNB stays because they do nothing to help out in a bad situation. NO refund etc.\", \"Great space for a large group of 5 girls. Close to everything!\", \"Top location. Smart rooms and great communal areas. Exactly as described.\", \"The location is awesome, but the actual space left a lot to be desired .The \\u201ccouch\\u201d was a collection of cushions and was basically unusable.<br/>While there is a kitchen there is no table and we didn\\u2019t even have any place to sit other than the \\u201ccouch\\u201d. The space is not suitable for more than 4 people. No vents in the bathrooms are also a huge issue. A lot to be desired for such a high price.\", \"Great location, friendly staff, very comfortable beds. Our group of 7 was quite comfortable.\", \"Great location, pretty view of the water, close to the subway, quiet, kitchen stocked well for our needs.  Beds were exceptionally comfortable!  Would definitely stay here again.\", \"everything was great, cheap\", \"Our group of eight had a great stay. The location was ideal, with short walks to shops, restaurants, and transit. It was tight, but accommodated our large group without making us feel too cramped. Our room was nice and clean, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. We will be staying here again.\", \"Great place in the financial district.  Subway is just a couple blocks away and it's a quick ride to Times Sq, etc.   Place is great and very quiet.  If we had neighbors, i never heard them.  Great views from our room as well.  HIGHLY recommended!\", \"Rented this place because my girlfriend thought it would be good.  <br/>I didn\\u2019t read the description or look at square footage before I reserved it. <br/>I guess it\\u2019s a good price for the size?<br/>Decent location.  Nothing too far or expensive if using Uber. <br/>The place felt secure and the kids enjoyed the game room.  Although if you\\u2019re a tourist, a game room isn\\u2019t necessary.  The free laundry mat was a pleasant surprise, in a city that\\u2019s super expensive.<br/>If you\\u2019re going and love coffee, you have to bring your own or buy some at the coffee shop in the lobby.  I was a little surprised there wasn\\u2019t a Keurig machine, but not a huge deal.  <br/>Overall, I would rent this place again if going with a bigger group.  Super clean and enough bed space for all of us.\", \"Great place to stay with your family or large group. Well designed and maintained rooms, would recommend it to any friend.\", \"Great location, very clean, it\\u2019s not luxurious but it\\u2019s exactly what you need if you don\\u2019t plan to spend a huge amount of time in the apartment and instead want to enjoy New York.\", \"n/a\", \"Super great place to stay.

The individual rooms made all the difference!! Love this place.\", \"Expect complete lack of communication and possibly not even having a place to stay.\", \"Good place to stay in NYC. Close to many travel destinations.\", \"Great and great house ever\", \"A fine place to stay if your intent is to only sleep in the Airbnb. There is not enough room for  more than 3 or 4 people to lounge around/hang out in the airbnb.<br/>Staff were friendly and check-in was easy.\", \"Great space. Exactly as shown on listing!!\", \"Loved our stay. Our group slept comfortably on the nice beds. Rooms felt soundproof. Front desk was quick and friendly. Check-in was smooth process. Loved that each room had their own temperature control. Good location.\", \"Great location and plenty of nice amenities\", \"Great place!\", \"Hotel that feels like a home; you get all the conveniences of being in a hotel while still feeling comfortable during your stay. The place was clean, the staff was exceptional, and the process was stress free.\", \"Exactly what was advertised. This is the third time we have used this space for our company.\", \"Great stay during my Ny visit!\", \"Great place to stay for a big group\", \"The place was great, exactly what I expected, very clean, view was great , no complications at all, also had a great night.\", \"Everyone was nice, nice area. Good food spots like cafe water are close!\", \"Front desk man was extremely rude about two of our guests not having masks and simply asking him if the hotel had any. Other than that great stay\", \"Very clean and neat with great staff,<br/>We celebrate my brother\\u2019s birthday on 9th floor, with huge modern full kitchen and equipments.<br/>Super friendly and helpful staff.<br/>Recommended to anyone,<br/>Simply great.\", \"Easy check in and check out process . Clean apartment. Two thumbs up\", \"Just an awesome find. Will definitely stay again\", \"WHEN YOU GET TO THE UNIT, THEY HAVE ALREADY ALLOWED YOU TO CHECK IN VIRTUALLY WITH A DIGITALLY KEY.

It was perfect for my group of friends and I. Amazing view too!\", \"Such a home-y vibe when staying at Front & Wall. The staff were also super helpful and accommodating.\", \"Super location. The hosts are super helpful. Street parking for overnight and there is a garage right across the hotel as well. The place is super clean, and reception was really helpful in assisting us with any queries. A must stay if you wanna experience downtown. Walking distance to all the attractions, bars, battery park and 911 memorial site\", \"Place was great and staff was super friendly/helpful\", \"Nice, clean rooms. The bedrooms are a bit small, but serviceable. The common area is bright and clean. The kitchen area is great.\", \"Good place to stay in NYC.  <br/>Ours was a 4-bedroom apt.  with kitchenette.   <br/>The couch in the living room is very small.  And there needs to be a TV in each bedroom. <br/>Great place to eat and drink next door.   <br/>We met the Bldg. GM who was very nice and open to suggestions.  The staff was very nice as well and attentive. <br/>Great security.   <br/>Easy check in. <br/>Compared to NYC hotel rooms (space and price) you can't go wrong.<br/>Will return!\", \"Great location. Several subway options!!\", \"The apartment was spacious, clean, and a great location. Check in was smooth and everyone was so friendly and helpful. Highly recommend staying at Front & Wall and experiencing what Lower Manhattan has to offer!\", \"Great individual space for everyone to enjoy there privacy.\", \"It was hard to find Airbnb in Manhattan for a large family. But this place made everyone happy: 4 rooms with queen size beds,  thermostat in each room and living room, 2 bathrooms. Soundproofed bedrooms with heavy curtains were perfect for a good night's sleep.\", \"We really liked the convenience of the apartment.  The decor is simple, but it has everything you need.  The in-building free laundry is super-convenient.  I was worried that the surrounding area might be dead at night, but there are actually quite a few bars and restaurants nearby.  It was great to have the Wall Street subway stations just 5 minutes walk away, especially since they are express stops for the 2/3 and 4/5 trains.  ACE is also convenient.\", \"We liked the unit, it\\u2019s was in a great location for us and it has very nice views,\", \"Good place to stay\", \"Perfect accommodation for us (four guys). Great location, staff on front desk fantastic,  comfortable beds, great views.  Will definitely stay again\", \"Highly recommend this location to all guests looking for a comfortable place to call home in NYC. Our space was the largest they offer with 4 bedrooms and it was spotless on arrival, beautiful views, and a painless check in process. The team was also kind enough to look after our baggage until it was time to check in which was a god-send as it allowed us to get on with our day and walk around the city.<br/>They also had laundry and a gym on site that were both well taken care of and very helpful to us. <br/>The location is fantastic as the ferry is a beautiful ride to most places and the subway stop is only a couple blocks away for quick access to the rest of Manhattan\", \"GREAT location (everything we had planned was within 5-10 mins walking distance) and nice calm vibes.

Also, there are bugs in the room (maybe due to windows being kept open) and there is no bath tub.\", \"Amazing location just a few blocks away from the train station.  As a family of four it was really hard to find a place in the city that had at least three bedrooms and more than one bathroom.

We had an excellent time and will definitely be staying here again.\", \"The whole room is brand new amazing<br/>Clean the cleanest<br/>Great for toddler\", \"El departamento estuvo muy bien.

He is a fabulous host and really goes out of his way to make sure you have a great experience.  For example, our group drove in from out of state, and Gonzalo knew we would be a little late getting in.  I messaged him when we were close.  As we came down his road, he was standing on the front steps with the light on.  He had also moved his own car down the street so that we could use his parking spot that first evening, because he knew we might have a tough time finding parking that late at night.  Wow!  We got a personal tour of the place, which was spotless, modern, and stocked with amenities like a Keurig, tea, and bottle water.  Gonzalo answered every question immediately.  His place is a quick drive from LaGuardia airport and walking distance from the train/subway to Manhattan.

There is a 7-eleven opposite, and lots of other shops, cafes and restaurants nearby so it is really convenient.<br/>Paul was a great host and gave us lots of useful information on arrival.
